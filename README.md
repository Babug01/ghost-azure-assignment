# Azure Web App Infrastructure for Ghost Application

This repository contains an ARM template that deploys and configures the required Azure resources for hosting a containerized web application. The infrastructure is designed to fulfill the following requirements:

- Scalability to handle varying loads.
- Consistent application behavior across user sessions.
- Resilient architecture for high availability.
- Observability for monitoring and diagnostics.
- Automated deployment of resources.
- Utilizes Azure Cloud services for the entire infrastructure.

## Infrastructure Overview

The ARM template in this repository provisions the following resources:

- **Azure Web App and App Hosting Plan:** Hosts the containerized web application.
- **Azure Key Vault:** Safely stores sensitive information like database passwords.
- **Log Analytics Workspace and Application Insights:** Monitors the application's performance and health.
- **Azure Database for MySQL Flexible:** Provides a database backend for the application.
- **Azure Front Door or Azure CDN (Based on Input):** Offloads traffic from the web app for improved performance.

## Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy the infrastructure:

1. [**Click here to deploy**](#) the ARM template to your Azure subscription.
   _(Provide a link or instructions to deploy the ARM template from your preferred location.)_

2. Fill in the required parameters in the deployment wizard, such as resource group name, region, application settings, etc.

3. Review the deployment settings and click "Deploy" to initiate the provisioning process.

4. Once the deployment is complete, you'll receive the necessary information to access and manage the resources.

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Log Analytics Workspace:** The Log Analytics workspace provides centralized monitoring and analytics for the application's logs and telemetry data.

- **Application Insights:** Application Insights provides real-time insights into the application's performance, user behavior, and exceptions.

## Scaling and Resilience

The Azure Web App's scaling configuration can be adjusted based on load using Azure's built-in autoscaling features.

For resilience, the architecture includes:

- **Azure Front Door:** Provides automatic failover across regions and global load balancing to ensure availability in case of regional failures.

- **Azure Database for MySQL:** Offers high availability configurations like geo-replication and automated backups.

## Automation and Deployment

The provided ARM template automates the deployment of the entire infrastructure. You can also consider using Azure Resource Manager templates in combination with Azure DevOps pipelines for a more advanced CI/CD setup.
